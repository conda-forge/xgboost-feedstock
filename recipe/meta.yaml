  summary: |
    Scalable, Portable and Distributed Gradient Boosting (GBDT, GBRT or GBM) Library, for
    Python, R, Java, Scala, C++ and more. Runs on single machine, Hadoop, Spark, Flink
    and DataFlow
  description: |
    XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient,
    flexible and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting
    framework. XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solve many
    data science problems in a fast and accurate way. The same code runs on major distributed
    environment (Hadoop, SGE, MPI) and can solve problems beyond billions of examples.
